R in the Lab: Principal Component Analysis to Many Responses
================

A brief R tutorial about how to perform a data analysis to compare four treatments data. This is achieved by fitting a analysis of variance model, summarizing and making some nice graphs for the data.

Note that I didn’t explain how I simulated the experimental data, but
you can see the code on paper\_data\_processing.R and data\_simulation.R in the analysis folder.

If you have cloned this repository and want to run this analysis from
scratch first run erase\_all\_outputs.R script and then run Main.R
script o whichever script you want.

You can read the presentation for this folder by clicking on: <a href="https://r-inthelab.netlify.app/2021/02/18/principal-component-analysis-to-many-responses/#loadings-line-plot" target="_blank">More than Two Treatments Comparison</a>.
